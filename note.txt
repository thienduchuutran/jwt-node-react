We can get id of an element by using a trick: hidden input tag like in user-update.ejs
<input hidden value="<%= userData.id%>" name="id"/>
That was for UPDATE functionality, where we already had info ready to be updated, just needed user id


Sequelize is a ORM tool helping us create models to interact with database
In folder config, file  config.json is where we initialize the connection to database through Sequelize,
thus we gather the connection to db in 1 file, ain't need to re-initialize the connection in
every function in services files

The index.js file in models folder is configuration of the database through ORM sequelize so that we can use db everywhere

"logging": false in config.json so that every time we interact with db, console won't log out raw sql queries

When working with database, defining a new table in model first (where we interact with the code), then migration file (where the code interacts with db)

A group can have many users but a user only has one group => in Group model we have Group.hasMany(models.User) and in User model we have User.belongsTo(models.Group)
A group can have many roles and a role can be in many groups => in Group model we have Group.belongsToMany(models.Role, { through: 'Group_Role'})
                                                                and in Role model we have Role.belongsToMany(models.Group, { through: 'Group_Role'})

A user can have many projects and a project can have many users => In User model we have User.belongsToMany(models.Project, {through: 'Project_User'})
                                                                and in Project model we have Project.belongsToMany(models.User, {through: 'Project_User'})
