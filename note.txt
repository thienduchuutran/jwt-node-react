We can get id of an element by using a trick: hidden input tag like in user-update.ejs
<input hidden value="<%= userData.id%>" name="id"/>
That was for UPDATE functionality, where we already had info ready to be updated, just needed user id


Sequelize is a ORM tool helping us create models to interact with database
In folder config, file  config.json is where we initialize the connection to database through Sequelize,
thus we gather the connection to db in 1 file, ain't need to re-initialize the connection in
every function in services files
